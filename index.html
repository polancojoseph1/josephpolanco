							<h1>Joseph Polanco</h1>
							<p>Greetings, I am a soon to be 2 time coding bootcamp graduate with 4 computer science
                classes under my belt. I am also 
                an aspiring software engineer. I am well versed in HTML, CSS, 
                Javascript, Python and more. I have a passion for the following 
                topics: Computer Science, Web Development, Languages(both programming 
                and non-programming), Databases, Data Structures and Algorithms.

                  <p>Early 2020, I was intruiged by the world of software. I took and completed Fullstack Academy, a coding bootcamp, where I learned HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js, React, Redux and Sequelize.</p>

                  <h2>Computer Science Courses Taken</h2>
                  <p>After graduating my first bootcamp, I decided that I wanted to learn more about computer programming at a fundamental level. 
                    So I decided independently to take computer science courses via Youtube. I have taken a total of 4 computer science courses. Introduction to Programming(CS50), The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs(CS61A), Object Oriented Programming/Data Structures(CS61B) 
                    and lastly Introduction to Algorithms(MIT 6.006).

									<h2>Soon-To-Be 2x Coding Bootcamp Graduate</h2>
									<p>Since Early 2022, I have been attending this bootcamp called General Assembly to increase my expertise in computer science and software. In GA, I am learning everything I learned at Fullstack Academy, 
                    plus more. I am learning DOM manipulation, Object Oriented Programming, Python, Flask, Django, MongoDB, SQL, and more. Most importantly what I am doing in GA are revisiting concepts. Revisiting these concepts 
                    the second time around is making these concepts start to click at a deep level.

									<h2>Linguist</h2>
									<p>My passion for software came from my love of languages. Since a teenager I have been studying and practicing multiple foreign languages like Portguese, French, Spanish, Tagalog(Filipino).
										It was only natural to turn my love of languages into an greater love for computer languages. This is what lead me to start learning Javascript and Python.

									<h2>Certified Teacher's Assistant</h2>
									<p>On my journey to learning more about software, I have been a Paraprofessional, or Teacher's Assistant, since January of 2018. 
                    In this role I learned a lot about communication, particularly breaking complex 
                    topics to make it digestable for those who are learning from me. This career has made me a 
                    great conversationalist, communicator, and most importantly it made me an expert
                    at simplifying complexed topics like Computer Science and Software Engineering.
